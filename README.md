# Overview

The program I made is a basic drawing app that is powered by the HTML5 canvas and TypeScript. The TypeScript code is made up of 6 classes that provide functionality to draw, change color, change line size, save your image, clear the canvas, and resize the canvas to dynamically fit whatever device you use it on.

# Development Environment

The tools I used to create this assignment are TypeScript, HTML5 canvas, CSS, and LinkedIn Learning. TypeScript creates the functionality of the application and was the new language I learned. The HTML5 canvas is an incredible tool for creating all kinds of different graphics. I watched a few tutorials of people creating video games with it which was really inspirational. I used CSS to put in a nice format and make the application visually pleasing. LinkedIn Learning is an incredibly useful tool that I learned about from a fellow classmate a while back with free tutorials.

TypeScript is a highly typed language that expands upon JavaScript. In fact, anything that would work in JavaScript would also work in TypeScrupt, just not the other way around. TypeScript actually has to be compiled into JavaScript in order for it to be of any use. I learned a lot about the HTML5 canvas library and found that it is made to be highly compatable with user interaction. I also learned a lot about the window library. I was trying for quite a while to get the canvas to resize to the page and got very familiar with it, and it's various methods.
