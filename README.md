# Overview

Creating this program improved my coding skills by learning a new language and finding creative solutions from a loosely structured starting point. It pushed my limits with what I've created before by allowing me to research and experiment with different approaches. I deepened my understanding of programming conceptually as a whole.

The program I made is a basic drawing app that is powered by the HTML5 canvas and TypeScript. The TypeScript code is made up of 6 classes that provide functionality to draw, change color, change line size, save your image, clear the canvas, and resize the canvas to dynamically fit whatever device you use it on. 

My purpose for writing this software is to expand my overall coding skills and learn a new language. TypScript is in high demand for Software Engineering jobs and I thought this would be the perfect oppertunity to dive in and learn.

# Development Environment

The tools I used to create this assignment are TypeScript, HTML5 canvas, CSS, LinkedIn Learning, and AI. TypeScript creates the functionality of the application and was the new language I learned. The HTML5 canvas is an incredible tool for creating all kinds of different graphics. I watched a few tutorials of people creating video games with it which was really inspirational. I used CSS to put in a nice format and make the application visually pleasing. LinkedIn Learning is an incredibly useful tool that I learned about from a fellow classmate a while back with free tutorials. Contrary to what a lot of people think, AI is also an amazing tool that I think is important to learn how to use responsibly and effectively. With it, I was able to give myself mini quizzes and create small coding challenges to increase my overall knowledge of TypeScript.

TypeScript is a highly typed language that expands upon JavaScript. In fact, anything that would work in JavaScript would also work in TypeScrupt, just not the other way around. TypeScript actually has to be compiled into JavaScript in order for it to be of any use. I learned a lot about the HTML5 canvas library and found that it is made to be highly compatable with user interaction. I also learned a lot about the window library. I was trying for quite a while to get the canvas to resize to the page and got very familiar with it, and it's various methods.

# Future Work


- Give myself more time to work on the project.
- Make one day about learning important libraries.
- Incorporate more small learning oppertunities the Kaizen way.
